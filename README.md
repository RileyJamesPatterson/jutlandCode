# Battle of Jutland â€“ NetLogo Simulation

This project models the **Battle of Jutland** using [NetLogo](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/).
The simulation starts at 7:15 UTC simulating the second crossing of the T. The goal of the simulation
was to investigate the following research question:

> **Research Question:**  
> Should Jellicoe have ordered the Grand fleet through the covering torpedo salvo to 
> remain in contact with the High Seas Fleet at dusk on May 31st?

Several variables, including the `German Disengage Signal Tick`, `British Delay Tick`, and
`British Signal` can be modified to examine changes in the model. Ultimately, this model confirms
the hypothesis that:

> **Hypothesis:**  
> Pursuing the German High Seas Fleet through the covering torpedo salvo would have resulted inÂ a
> route of the German Fleet - a minor increase in British material losses but a dramatic increase
> in German material losses.

## Project Overview

- **NetLogo Model**: A simulation of British and German fleet actions based on historical maneuvers and signal interpretation.
- **Input Data**: `.csv` files based on historical data specifying run configurations and fleet variables.
- **Python Plotting**: Post-simulation visualizations to evaluate key metrics like engagement outcomes, signal responses, and fleet behaviors.

## ðŸ“Š Plotting Results with Python

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the `result_plotting/` directory:

   ```bash
   cd result_plotting/
   ```

2. Set up a virtual environment and install dependencies:

   ```bash
   sh ./make_venv.sh
   ```

3. Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source msmg_venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. Run the plot generator:

   ```bash
   python3 plot_generator.py
   ```


Results will be generated in a new `plots` directory organized by plot types
